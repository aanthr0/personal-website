				​ ​ ​ ​ I am a passionate programmer with tons of experience in making Discord bots.<br>
				Website design and development has interested me since the dawn of time, and I would like to explore the topic and learn more about it.<br>
				I would also love to learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence, so I could one day make something like <a href="https://personofinterest.fandom.com/wiki/The_Machine">this</a>.<br>
				The reward of finishing a project is what drives me on and makes me start more projects and satisfy myself with the use of my time.<br>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				​ ​ ​ ​ ​My first project was a simple Discord bot made in Python, as that was the only programming language I knew at the time.<br>
				The bot had some basic features, like moderation and fun, and I really enjoyed making it because it was a new experience for me.<br>
				I have since made more bots, though I cancelled those projects as the people working on them with me weren't actually doing anything.<br>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				​ ​ ​ ​ ​Programming will forever be an interesting subject for me and I am excited to see what new projects I can come up with and work on.<br>
				I think that it's one of those subjects you can never actually stop learning, which is why it fascinates me so much.<br>
				But enough of that, because that's about it for me, if you want to reach out and talk, feel free to visit the contact page and see how you can send a message.<br>
				<br>
				Until then, <br>
				​ ​ ​​Goodbye, John.
