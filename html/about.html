        <h4>
          Hello! Thanks for checking out my website.<br>
          I don't feel comfortable with sharing my real name online, but when translated to English, my name is John, so you can call me that.
        </h4>        

        <h6>
          This is the first website I've made and I wanted it to look really nice, so it took a lot of effort to figure out everything I need to get started.<br>
          I'm currently learning HTML and CSS to improve my website development skills as much as I can.<br>
          Other than that, I often find myself making Discord bots (using JavaScript, though I started out with Python), though I haven't been making any as of late because I feel like there is no unique bot to make.<br>
          If I code any more bots, it's either going to be on a topic I find interesting, unique, a learning experience, a commission, or personal.<br>
          I'm not using React, vue.js or anything such for this website, as I wanted to learn how to make basic websites first, but I do plan on learning how to use those.<br>
          
          The first time I tried to code, I wanted to make my own Minecraft plugin, but when I realised I don't understand anything the person in the tutorial was talking about, I gave up quickly.<br>
          Fast-forward to 5th grade, and I'm taking Computer Class (as it was an optional class, though the next year it was mandatory) and we had to make some simple Python programs, like adding up numbers and such.<br>
          The following year, I decided to sign up for Programming classes (held by the same teacher) and I absolutely loved it.<br>
          The programs I made were actually made for a programming competition couple years back, that were given to students as something to practice on.<br>
          When the next competition came, the teacher insisted that I should sign up, so I did.<br>
          I didn't move on to the county competition, because the first task at the school competition was something with lists, which we didn't learn in regular computer class, let alone in programming classes (oh and that task was supposed to be in the county competition, by which, if I passed the school one, I would've learned it).<br>
            
          Around then, I was very interested in the concept of Discord bots, and I wanted to create one myself.<br>
          I looked up a tutorial on how to make one and saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-zOCvDCayyYy1flR5qaAg" style="color: #ffffff;">this guy's</a> video, and started to watch it.<br>
          Back then, the "async" version of discord.py was almost outdated, as the "rewrite" version was in the making.<br>
          That bot was complete garbage though, as it only had a couple commands and didn't even check user permissions.<br>
          The semester ended some time soon and I quickly lost motivation for coding.<br>
          
          Fast-forward to October 2020, and I wanted to make Discord bots again. I immediately checked out Lucas' to see if he still had his old async videos up, and I saw that he made videos on rewrite, which was perfect.<br>
          One day, I was hanging out in the discord.py support server and I saw someone needing help with their bot, and I was very familiar with what they needed, so I decided to show him what he needed to do.<br>
          He invited me to be part of the development team for his (now defunct) listing bot, and I gladly accepted it.<br>
          I soon abandoned development of my own bot and decided to fully join his team, though that didn't last very long.<br>
          When that bot fell apart, I decided to pick up where I left off with my own bot. I wanted to add an economy system for that bot, and as I didn't really know any database, other than JSON, and the listing bot was eventually made in JavaScript with quick.db, I decided to use that.<br>
          For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea to code half of my bot (feature-wise) in Python, and half in JavaScript (spoiler alert, it wasn't).<br>
          The bot had so many bugs, fixing which would probably uncover more bugs, so I decided to scrap that and remake the bot, only this time, it fully be written in JavaScript.<br>
          I honestly had no idea what I was doing, but through trial and error, I got there and made a bot that I really liked.<br>
            
          Fast-forward again, and we're here! After some unsuccessful bot attempts (which I plan on redoing) while working with a team, I decided to go solo. I tried to make a giveaway bot, but it was really boring for me, and I had planned to learn web development at some point anyways, so I decided to do that sooner, rather than later.<br>
          I've met some great friends along this way and I'm extremely lucky for knowing them.<br>
          Fun fact; at the time of writing the draft for a major part of this page, I was in a voice call with one of them, and I was having a genuinely good time.<br>

          Well, that's about it for me, I enjoyed looking back on some of these moments while writing this whole page.<br>
          I'm very thankful for what I've got and where I've gotten to. I love and support all my friends that have come along this journey of mine, and I hope that I can look back on this whole phase of my life as a time well spent.<br>
          
          Cheers,<br>
            John.<br>
