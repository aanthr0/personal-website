        <h4>
          Hello! Thanks for checking out my website.<br>
          I don't feel comfortable with sharing my real name online, so you can call me John.<br>
        </h4>
        <h5>
          This is the first website I've made and I wanted it to look really nice, so it took a lot of effort to figure out everything I need to get started.<br>
          I'm currently learning HTML and CSS to improve my website development skills as much as I can.<br>
          I'm not using React, vue.js or anything such for this website, as I wanted to learn how to make basic websites first, but I do plan on learning how to use those.<br>
        </h5>
        <h3>
          About Me
        </h3>
        <h6>
          I've been familiar with programming since my 5th grade Computer Class where we had to make some simple Python code.<br>
          This code was really simple, like adding up numbers or looping through code infinitely.<br>
          Around that time, I was very interested in the concept of Discord bots, more specifically, making them.<br>
          I looked up a Discord bot making tutorial on YouTube, and saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-zOCvDCayyYy1flR5qaAg" style="color: #f0f0f0;">this guy</a>'s video.<br>
          It was very easy to get started, and he explained everything very clearly, making it easy to understand what he was doing.<br>
          I enjoyed making that bot and it was a great learning experience for me.<br>
          Unfortunately, after 6th grade, I quickly lost motivation for coding, to a reason that is actually unknown to me.<br>
        </h6>
        <h6>
          Although, fast-forward to somewhere around October 2020., I wanted to make bots again.<br>
          Since my last semester's curriculum didn't include programming, I had to brush up on my Python skills.<br>
          I felt good because I started to code again, because now I actually had something to do on the side, other than playing video-games.<br>
          The first bot I made was called "Reaper" and I really enjoyed making it beacuse it felt refreshing to do something different in a very long while.<br>
          While I was looking for somewhere to host my bot, I came across <a href="https://bluefoxhost.com/" style="color: #f0f0f0;">BlueFox</a>, the same hosting service linked in my Home page.<br>
          I made great friends in their official <a href="https://discord.gg/rx89wWB" style="color: #f0f0f0;">Discord server</a>, including the CEO of the service itself.<br>
          Unfortunately, Reaper didn't last very long, as there were so many bugs I'd be better off with scrapping the code and remaking the bot.<br>
        </h6>
        <h6>
          That remake never really happened because I was getting bored out by the project, though I still had something in mind.<br>
          After getting more JavaScript experience, I decided to create a small development team with my friends where we would actually make bots.<br>
          But, history repeated itself, and after one of my friend's "incidents", the team lasted for maybe a week or two before we stopped due to inactivity.<br>
          For some reason though, one of the members of the development team decided to reopen and start over recently, so we'll see how that goes.<br>
        </h6>
        <h6>
          From here on, I can only assume what happens next. I've met some great friends over the past 5-ish months that I've <em>actually</em> been doing programming.<br>
          I'm really thankful for what I've got, who I've got, and how I've gotten here, and I can't even imagine how this phase of my life would turn out if it weren't for them.<br>
          With that said, I wish you all the best, and I hope you too succeed in whatever side-project or hobby you have.<br>
        </h6>
        <h5 class="cheers">
          Cheers,<br>
